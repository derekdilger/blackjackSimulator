Why make blackjacksim?
I'm interested in answering the questions below. Counting techniques like combinations and permutations cannot work for all questions.
312! is 2 * 10^644, intractable, a number that would be used in the counting techniques approach.
The exact approach would require handling annoying fractions like 23/24 * 22/23 * ... (such as when counting red twos in shoe), and these numbers would be part of a branching tree of possibilities of ways the dealer may bust.
// the below line is false it turns out
The expected value for the redflex is dependent on the buster bet. How can the EV for each together be calculated with pure math? The EV for each separately? I don't know.
The finite deck affects dependence for other bets, too.
Personally I find it easier and more fun to make the simulator as opposed to the (afaik) infeasible counting techniques approach.

How close is the shoe to being random? Does the finiteness have an impact? What's the difference in EV and %-chance-of-payout for all bets when comparing an infinite shoe vs finite?

While the game overall may be negative EV for the player, certain spots are not. What are those spots? And by what amount are they EV positive?

What's the expected value of a $100 redflex bet?  //update: 96.51

What's the % chance of a BB payout?

What's the expected value of a $100 BB? (EV < $100)

What's the % chance the player's hand beats the dealer's hand with perfect basic strategy?

What's the expected value of a $100 mainline bet with perfect basic strategy?

Does PES use the best possible basic strategy? Can an improvement be made?

What's the % chance of hitting each of the following sideline outcomes?
    Red flex (RF) payout schedule: 
    num_dealer_reds:    2   3   4   5   6   7
    payout_odds    :    2   3   8   50  100 250

    Buster Bet (BB) payout schedule: 
    num_dealer_cards:   3   4   5   6   7   8
    payout_odds     :   2   2   4   12  100 250

What's the difference in expected value when the player solely doubles down for 50% of their original mainline, vs 100%? 0% (never DD)?
